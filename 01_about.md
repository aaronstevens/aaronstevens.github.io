![Aaron](/assets/aaron.jpg "This is Aaron!")

Hey there! I'm Aaron Stevens, a 31 year old I.T. technician who currently volunteers at [Computers for Charities](http://www.computersforcharities.org) based in Hailsham, England. My role there involves troubleshooting and refurbishing used systems donated in by businesses & universities. The process involves securely wiping hard drives and installing a fresh copy of either Windows XP or 7, drivers, requested software, and then lastly cleaned up. These machines are then sent out to other charities and churches in the UK, and even in bulk to nations in Africa.

## Pastimes

I have a personal interest in computer technology and keep up with current developments. I also enjoy building and maintaining all my computer devices at home, keeping them optimized and performing well, and at the same time resolving almost all issues that come up.

## Current and Past Projects

#### This Jekyll Blog!

After some badgering from @j-mes and @virtuosus I got around to creating a Github account to host a Jekyll blog system. Which is, to [quote](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/):

>_"Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through Markdown (or Textile) and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server."_

So far it's pretty fun to work on, and I'm impressed by how it works!

#### MSFN

I created [MSFN.org](http://www.msfn.org) (Microsoft Software Forum Network) in 2001 as a non-profit website to publish Microsoft news and be involved in an active community helping out with forum usersâ€™ Windows issues. The website rose to its peak in 2003 when I wrote simple guides aimed at the end-user for the first time on how to create an unattended Windows XP deployment CD, with custom tweaks and additional software.
