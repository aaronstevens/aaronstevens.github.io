### This Jekyll Blog!

After some badgering from @j-mes and @virtuosus I got around to creating a Github account to host a Jekyll blog system. Which is, to [quote](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/):

>_"Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through Markdown (or Textile) and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server."_

So far it's pretty fun to work on, and I'm impressed by how it works!

### Home Theater PC

In 2011, I set out to spec and build a cost-effective system for watching media with hardware acceleration. My previous setup involved using a 10m HDMI cable from the PC to TV and extending the displays, but this wasn't very convenient as I always had to get out of the sofa to access the keyboard on the PC to pause/rewind or adjust subtitle sync.

I initally planned on an Intel Sandy Bridge i3 build and making use of the onboard HD graphics which would have been sufficient for 1080p playback, but I later added a discrete graphics card due to an unfixable 24hz refresh rate bug on the Sandy Bridge architecture - which was causing a slight playback hitch every ~50 seconds on 23.976fps content.

I also had the idea of using it as a NAS of sorts, so I added a 2TB drive in there and had SyncBack mirror the latest changes from my PC daily at 6pm over a gigabit link. It's always a good idea to have a backup!

### MSFN

I created [MSFN.org](http://www.msfn.org) (Microsoft Software Forum Network) in 2001 as a non-profit website to publish Microsoft news and be involved in an active community helping out with forum usersâ€™ Windows issues. The website rose to its peak in 2003 when I wrote simple guides aimed at the end-user for the first time on how to create an unattended Windows XP deployment CD, with the latest hotfixes, custom tweaks, and additional software all installed automatically.

The effects of publishing a guide like this are still felt today, with third-party applications such as nLite and DriverPacks being born as a result, and popular among those attempting this project.
