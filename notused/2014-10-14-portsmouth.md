Made the decision last week to move to Portsmouth as a friend was offering his spare room out for rent, I'm settled in now and enjoying independence for once! It was sad to leave behind my friends/family and volunteer work in Hailsham, but such big steps need to be made if I want to find work and get independence. A new chapter begins...
